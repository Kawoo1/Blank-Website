        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
        <p>Yes, it is true. This website is EMPTY. But that's because this was only a rudimentary test. No CSS attached, no fleshed out HTML. Simply just me and you. Thank you for viewing.
        <br> If you would like to collaborate in web design or other fundemental coding projects. Please leave a comment on my page. Otherwise, message me on Instagram, by email, or on Facebook (If it still exists). Thanks!
        </p><p>Programming can be accomplished  at any level! Personally, I preferred high level programming languages like python, javascript and HTML/CSS but theres plenty of mid level and 
            low level programming languages able to be learned and mastered. SQL is important in the world of data management and is used by services even as large as Amazon's AWS.

        <p>There's always more to discover with Cascading Style Sheets. There's even a more capable version of it called CSS3. Or, cascading style sheets level 3.
        I made this with just regular CSS, but can you only imagine what CSS3 can do!? Here's an image of a cute bunny from the internet</p>
