        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
        <p>Yes, it is true. This website is EMPTY. But that's because this was only a rudimentary test. No CSS attached, no fleshed-out HTML. Simply just me and you. Thank you for viewing.
            <br> If you would like to collaborate in web design or other fundamental coding projects, please leave a comment on my page. Otherwise, message me on Instagram, by email, or on Facebook (If it still exists). Thanks!
        </p>
        <p>Programming can be accomplished at any level! Personally, I preferred high-level programming languages like python, javascript and HTML/CSS but there's plenty of mid-level and low-level programming languages able to be learned and mastered. SQL is important in the world of data management and is used by services even as large as Amazon's AWS.

        <h2>Like to Game?</h2>
        <p>There are lots of games available online. Steam/Epic/Origin offer sales every season. Currently Rockstar publishings are having sales up to 70% off on their games!</p>
        <p>Steam has a weekly sale that involves a certain category of games. If you have emails enabled, games on your wishlist that have gone on sale
            will be notified to your email! If there's a game you've wanted for a long time, check your emails on a weekly basis. It might come up with a nice
            juicy discount. </p>

        <p>There's always more to discover with Cascading Style Sheets. DCoder (not sponsored) is a mobile app that allows coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, and C++. There's even a more capable version of it called CSS3. Or, cascading style sheets level 3.
        I made this with just regular CSS, but can you only imagine what CSS3 can do!? Here's an image of a cute bunny from the internet. </p>
